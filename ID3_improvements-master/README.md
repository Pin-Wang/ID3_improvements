# ID3_improvements
My improvments on ID3(Iterative Dichotomiser 3), a classic data mining algorithm put forward by Quinlan in 1986. 

This is a course homework of pattern recongnition.

There are 4 branches in this repository:

1. branch-master: the original ID3 algorithm implemented in Weka
2. branch-gain_ratio: Change the original information gain to gain ratio when deciding which attribute to split the tree
3. branch-naive_bayes: Change the simple voting procedure to naive bayes methods
4. branch-random_forest: Build up a random forest from many ID3 trees

The programs are secondary developments on Weka.
